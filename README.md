Deep learning for automatically fixing single-line syntax errors in C programs.

Objective - To design, implement and evaluate a deep learning based solution to fix syntactic errors in C programs. The programs were written in introductory programming assignments and contain single-line errors. This will require preparing the data for deep learning, implementing a deep learning model for sequence-to-sequence translation (that is, from a buggy program to its fix), and training and evaluating the deep learning model.

Train a sequence to sequence neural network to map the token sequence of buggy line in the input program to the corresponding fixed line.
